# URGENT: Fix Cloudinary Not Working on Render

## The Problem
Videos are being saved locally on Render instead of Cloudinary, causing 404 errors.

Backend logs show:
```
✓ Video saved locally: uploads/video-1767551966449.mp4
```

Should show:
```
✓ Cloudinary configured for cloud storage
✓ Video uploaded to Cloudinary: https://res.cloudinary.com/...
```

## The Fix (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: Verify Cloudinary Env Vars in Render

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your backend service
3. Click **Environment** tab
4. **CHECK** these 3 variables exist:
   - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = `djhd8bsgr`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` = `937585771348383`
   - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` = `5lyQMjNBX6ZTpdqSa3EecMQAifU`

### Step 2: Manual Redeploy

**IMPORTANT**: Just adding env vars is NOT enough. You MUST redeploy!

1. In Render dashboard, click **Manual Deploy** button (top right)
2. Click **Deploy latest commit**
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete

### Step 3: Verify Cloudinary is Working

1. Check Render logs (should see):
   ```
   ✓ Cloudinary configured for cloud storage
   ```

2. Upload a NEW video from Vercel frontend

3. Check Render logs again (should see):
   ```
   ✓ Video uploaded to Cloudinary: https://res.cloudinary.com/djhd8bsgr/...
   ```

4. Video should play and persist!

## Why This Happens

- Render doesn't auto-reload env vars
- You must manually redeploy after adding/changing env vars
- Without redeploy, backend uses old code without Cloudinary

## If Still Not Working

Check Render logs for errors:
- "CloudinaryStorage not available" → Package issue
- "Video saved locally" → Env vars not loaded
- "Cloudinary configured" → Working correctly!

## Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ Videos upload to Cloudinary
✅ Thumbnails auto-generated by Cloudinary  
✅ Videos persist across Render redeploys
✅ No 404 errors
✅ Videos play from Cloudinary CDN URLs
